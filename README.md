# Bituitus

Just one more mobile-first & starter child-theme for Genesis.

## Parent Theme

Bituitus is a child theme of Genesis. You must have it installed to use this theme.

## The Bituitus Snippets repository

I'm planning to share some specific programming snippets for Bituitus Theme (and it's parent-theme Genesis) at [Bituitus Snippets](https://github.com/trsenna/bituitus-snippets) repository. When developing a new child-theme based on Bituitus Theme, make sure to check if new snippets were added. So you can easily copy and paste them into your themes and projects.
